      <description>Blurb I am a current Masters student at EPFL in the department of Life Sciences and Technology. I completed my BSc in Cell Biology and Anatomy, specializing in genetics, with a minor in Mathematics at McGill University, Canada.
It is here at EPFL where I feel like I have finally found my place in the scientific domain. I have developed a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in particular, their applications to the health sciences.</description>
