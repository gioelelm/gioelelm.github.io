      <description>Short Bio I have recently completed my Masters at Moscow State University, Department of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics. During my undergraduate studies Iâ€™ve worked in a molecular biology lab and received a comprehensive training in many techniques. Both of my internships, one in the Weis lab at ETH Zurich and another in the Seigert lab at IST Austria, helped me realize that molecular neuroscience is the most exciting branch of modern biology to me.</description>

      <description>Short Bio I am a PhD student in the Computational and Quantitative Biology (EDCB) program at EPFL. Originally from the United States, I completed my BSc in Molecular Biology and Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh before working as a research fellow at EMBL Heidelberg.
During my studies, I have been captivated by the concept of temporal omics and bioinformatics in light of the big data boom and advances in next-generation sequencing technologies.</description>
