      <description>Short Bio I am a Master&amp;rsquo;s student in the Life Sciences Engineering program at EPFL. Prior to arriving at EPFL, I completed four years of the six-year program in Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at the Lomonosov Moscow State University.
My engagement with La Manno lab began in 2021 when I had the privilege of joining as a grant recipient of the Zimin Foundation - SMTB Alumni Summer Research Program. The following year, I officially joined the La Manno lab team as a student research assistant.</description>
