      <description>Bio I earned my PhD at Karolinska Instituet and I am proud alumnus of the Linnarsson Lab. My original training is in Biotechnology (BSc @UNIPA) and Biomedicine (MSc @KI) but nowadays I will probably turn around if somebody is calling out for a Molecular Biologist, Computational Biologist or Bioinformatician.
My research focuses on understanding brain development. I am particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons.</description>

The research project offered will be focused on the spatio-temporal organization of neural progenitor cells across the developing nervous systems in health and disease. The project, funded by SNF, is low-risk and high-impact.
The overarching goal is understanding the functional implications of the distribution and abundance of radial glial subtypes and the modalities teratogens and metabolic alterations can disrupt it.</description>
