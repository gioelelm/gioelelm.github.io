      <description>Bio I earned my PhD at Karolinska Instituet and I am proud alumnus of the Linnarsson Lab. My original training is in Biotechnology (BSc @UNIPA) and Biomedicine (MSc @KI) but nowadays I will probably turn around if somebody is calling out for a Molecular Biologist, Computational Biologist or Bioinformatician.
My research focuses on understanding brain development. I am particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons.</description>

      <description>Openings and available projects Postdoctoral researcher Read the full call in pdf here!
The research project offered will be focused on developing new computational approaches to integrate single-cell/nuclei RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data generated from archival material. The successful candidate will develop new analysis approaches and apply them to a comprehensive human oligodendroglia dataset. The overarching goal is understanding gene regulation in the specification and maintenance of oligodendrocyte lineage in the human brain.</description>
