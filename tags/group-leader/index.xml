      <description>Openings and available projects Postdoctoral and PhD student positions There are no open positions at the moment. Outstanding candidates might still be considered, to enquires please contact me at gioele.lamanno@epfl.ch.
For Ph.D. students, while direct enquiries are appreciated, to become a Ph.D. student in the lab an official application needs to go through official channels of EPFL-SV doctoral schools: EDNE, EDCB or EDMS. PhD recruitment happens only twice per year, so if interested please keep an eye on the application deadlines.</description>

      <description>Bio I earned my PhD at Karolinska Instituet and I am proud alumnus of the Linnarsson Lab. My original training is in Biotechnology (BSc @UNIPA) and Biomedicine (MSc @KI) but nowadays I will probably turn around if somebody is calling out for a Molecular Biologist, Computational Biologist or Bioinformatician.
My research focuses on understanding brain development. I am particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons.</description>
