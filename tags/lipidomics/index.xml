      <description>We are excited to announce the release of our preprint &amp;ldquo;The Lipidomics Architecture of the Mouse Brain&amp;rdquo; on bioRxiv!
This work represents a major milestone for our lab, presenting the first comprehensive spatial lipidomic atlas of the adult mouse brain. Using high-resolution MALDI mass spectrometry imaging, we mapped 172 membrane lipids across 109 sections and 11 brains, all registered to the Allen Brain Atlas.
Key findings: - We identified 539 spatially coherent biochemical domains, which we call &amp;ldquo;lipizones&amp;rdquo; - Lipizones capture both neuronal cell bodies and their distal terminals - White matter shows marked regional heterogeneity driven by oligodendrocyte-specific lipids - We discovered that pregnancy induces coordinated lipid remodeling in the cortex and white matter</description>

      <description>The overall lipid composition of cell membranes is defined by variations in the concentration of hundreds of individual species. Although, in principle, the unconstrained variations of lipid levels are able to generate infinite combinations of lipid composition, the action of regulatory circuits restricts the spectrum of possible lipid configurations in a given cell and under given conditions. Lipid configurations can be seen as a finite number of states that represent local energetic minima of the lipid compositional landscape.</description>

      <title>From cell fat to cell fate</title>

      <description>In multicellular organisms, cells are parts of communities in which an individual contributes to the collective phenotype of the community. Appreciating the “social” organization of these cell communities is instrumental to dissecting their physiology and the pathological consequences of their abnormalities. In Capolupo et al. we investigated the lipid metabolism and gene expression of individual human skin cells and found that specific lipid compositions drive cell specialization. Specifically, we found that sphingolipids determine the transcriptional programs of fibroblasts populating in different layers of the human skin.</description>
