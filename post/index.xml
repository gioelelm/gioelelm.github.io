      <description>The overall lipid composition of cell membranes is defined by variations in the concentration of hundreds of individual species. Although, in principle, the unconstrained variations of lipid levels are able to generate infinite combinations of lipid composition, the action of regulatory circuits restricts the spectrum of possible lipid configurations in a given cell and under given conditions. Lipid configurations can be seen as a finite number of states that represent local energetic minima of the lipid compositional landscape.</description>

      <description>In multicellular organisms, cells are parts of communities in which an individual contributes to the collective phenotype of the community. Appreciating the “social” organization of these cell communities is instrumental to dissecting their physiology and the pathological consequences of their abnormalities. In Capolupo et al. we investigated the lipid metabolism and gene expression of individual human skin cells and found that specific lipid compositions drive cell specialization. Specifically, we found that sphingolipids determine the transcriptional programs of fibroblasts populating in different layers of the human skin.</description>

      <title>First preprint of the lab: spatial-omics by tomography!</title>

      <description>We just released the first preprint of the lab, find it here.
This is the summary of what the paper is about:
Genomics techniques are currently being adapted to provide spatially resolved omics profiling. However, the adaptation of each new method typically requires the setup of specific detection strategies or specialized instrumentation. A generic approach to spatially resolve different types of high throughput data is missing. Here, we describe an imaging-free framework to localize high throughput readouts within a tissue by combining compressive sampling and image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>RNA velocity is out in Nature</title>

      <description>In a previous preprint RNA velocity in single cells we had presented the discovery that standard RNA-seq data contains additional information on the rate and direction of change in gene expression. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read what this is about you can see my previous post or directly go and read the more eloquent Nature News and Views kindly written by Allon Klein.
Now our work has gone through the process of peer review.</description>

      <title>Visiting EPFL and super-postdocs in Europe</title>

      <description>Over the last few days I have been at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. The reason of this little trip is that the School of Life Sciences at EPFL recently opened a special position, the fellowship goes under the long name &amp;ldquo;EPFL Life Sciences Early Independence Research Scholar&amp;rdquo; shortened &amp;ldquo;ELIFR fellow&amp;rdquo;.
To explain what an ELIFR fellow is I could simply refer to it as a &amp;ldquo;super-postdoc&amp;rdquo;, a funny term popularized by this commentary on Cell but maybe, not yet so popular in Europe (so that I noticed that using it in a conversation often produces raised eyebrows and a grin or two).</description>

      <title>osmFISH is really awesome</title>

      <description>Simone Codelluppi and Lars Borm have developed and optimized a cyclic smFISH protocol, termed ouroboros smFISH, to quantify the expression of a large number of genes in tissue sections. The goal was building a cell type map of the mouse somatosensory cortex. The results are really impressive. See the fantastic images and interactively explore the data using the Loom viewer here.
Great news are not only is taht Lars and Simore have put a lot of effort to make it possible for any lab to set up the method and they provide detailed protocol and a polished software package.</description>

      <description>Single-cell RNA-seq measurements provide a powerful approach for studying complex biological tissues. Some of the more interesting contexts involve dynamic processes, such as development or disease progression. However single-cell measurements only capture a snapshot of a transcriptional state at a single point in time.
Several approaches have been developed to infer dynamic processes, such as branching lineages from this scRNA-seq. Usually those methods require many strong assumptions that are often violated.</description>
