      <title>Lipid Brain Atlas preprint released</title>
      <link>/post/lipid_brain_atlas/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the release of our preprint &amp;ldquo;The Lipidomics Architecture of the Mouse Brain&amp;rdquo; on bioRxiv!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work represents a major milestone for our lab, presenting the first comprehensive spatial lipidomic atlas of the adult mouse brain. Using high-resolution MALDI mass spectrometry imaging, we mapped 172 membrane lipids across 109 sections and 11 brains, all registered to the Allen Brain Atlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key findings:
- We identified 539 spatially coherent biochemical domains, which we call &amp;ldquo;lipizones&amp;rdquo;
- Lipizones capture both neuronal cell bodies and their distal terminals
- White matter shows marked regional heterogeneity driven by oligodendrocyte-specific lipids
- We discovered that pregnancy induces coordinated lipid remodeling in the cortex and white matter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This atlas establishes lipids as an important and previously unexplored axis of molecular brain architecture. The preprint is currently in revision at Nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the preprint: &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.10.13.682018&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are proud to announce that Dr. Antonio Herrera, a postdoctoral researcher in our lab since 2021, has been awarded a prestigious Ramón y Cajal fellowship!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toni will start his own research group at the University of Granada, Spain, in the second half of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his time in the La Manno Lab, Toni has made fundamental contributions to our research program, including developing computational methods for spatial transcriptomics analysis and contributing to multiple high-impact publications. His work on deep learning methods for imaging and spatial biology has been particularly impactful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to see Toni establish his own independent research program and look forward to future collaborations. Congratulations Toni!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to announce that Irina Khven has successfully defended her PhD thesis!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irina&amp;rsquo;s thesis, &amp;ldquo;Fine-grained mapping of neural progenitors subtypes in the embryonic brain unveils context-dependent roles of signalling on cell fate decisions,&amp;rdquo; represents a major contribution to our understanding of brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During her PhD in the EDNE program (2019-2025), Irina made fundamental contributions to mapping neural progenitor diversity using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell approaches. Her work has been instrumental in establishing the lab&amp;rsquo;s spatial transcriptomics capabilities and generating some of the most comprehensive datasets on embryonic brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irina will continue her scientific career as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations Dr. Khven, and best wishes for your future research!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ERC Starting Grant MOVIOLA awarded</title>
      <link>/post/erc_moviola/</link>

      <guid>/post/erc_moviola/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce that the La Manno Lab has been awarded a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant for the project &amp;ldquo;MOVIOLA: Cell decision capture and control via joint Raman live and omics profiling.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 5-year grant (Feb 2026 - Jan 2031, 1.5 million euros) will support our research into understanding the molecular determinants that govern neural cell fate decisions during human brain development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MOVIOLA project introduces a novel experimental paradigm that combines live Raman microscopy with multi-modal molecular profiling to capture cells at the precise moments when fate decisions occur. We will develop the &amp;ldquo;Rewind, Halt &amp;amp; Edit&amp;rdquo; methodology, which enables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrospective identification of decision points through continuous cellular monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeted profiling at critical moments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporal manipulation of decision factors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural systems, we aim to identify the specific molecular factors—including transcription cascades, signaling pathways, metabolic states, and lipid compositions—that drive individual fate choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ERC Starting Grant is one of the most prestigious and competitive funding schemes for early-career researchers in Europe, and we are grateful for this opportunity to advance our research program.&lt;/p&gt;
