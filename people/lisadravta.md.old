# Short Bio

I have joined the La Manno Lab for a semester project as part of my Master's program in Computational Neurosciences. I will be looking into extracting new information from the [single cell atlas](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.02.184051v1.full) of the developmental mouse brain. My background is in Life Sciences and Engineering, with a special focus on neurosciences, genomics, programming and data analysis.
