# Short Bio

I am a joint PhD student in the Neuroscience Program (EDNE) between the La Manno and [D'Angelo Labs](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dangelo-lab/). I completed my MSc degree in University of Fribourg, working on Drosophila larval [circadian rhythms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59614-y). My current project focuses on lipidomics and neuroscience, as in the central nervous system, lipids play a crucial role by influencing the firing of neurons and synaptic plasticity. To address the lacking knowledge of lipid metabolism in different brain regions, we aim to build a high-resolution atlas of lipid metabolism in adult mouse brain, both in health and disease conditions. As a group, we thrive to bring a better understanding to questions we are curious about and hope to develop novel approaches.
