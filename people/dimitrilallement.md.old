# Short Bio

I am a final-year student in a Master of Computer Science and I am part of an exchange program at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) for a semester.
I completed my bachelor in computer science at the [Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble](http://www.grenoble-inp.fr/en) and for the last couple years I have been working part time for the French space agency: the [CNES](https://cnes.fr/en). 
I am a member of a machine learning project that aims to apply artificial intelligence concepts on business data. This project gives me the opportunity to work on various data types (space, financial...).

Currently, I wish to investigate biological data through my Master's project.
I am glad that my studies led me to work in the biology branch, which allows me to explore new biological analysis techniques. 
I am extremely interested in the evolution of data sciences and the new perspectives they offer.
