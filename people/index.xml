      <description>Short Bio I have recently completed my Masters at Moscow State University, Department of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics. During my undergraduate studies I’ve worked in a molecular biology lab and received a comprehensive training in many techniques. Both of my internships - in Weis lab at ETH Zurich and in Seigert lab at IST Austria - helped me realize that molecular neuroscience is the most exciting branch of modern biology to me.</description>

      <description>Short Bio I am an incoming PhD student of the Computational and Quantitative Biology (EDCB) Program at EPFL. Originally from the United States, I completed my BSc in Molecular Biology and Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh before working as a bioinformatician at EMBL Heidelberg.
During my studies, I have been captivated by the rapidly-growing field of bioinformatics in light of the big data boom and ongoing advances in next-generation sequencing technologies.</description>

      <description>Short Bio I am a final-year student in a Master of Computer Science and I am part of an exchange program at EPFL for a semester. I completed my bachelor in computer science at the Polytechnic Institute of Grenoble and for the last couple years I have been working part time for the French space agency: the CNES. I am a member of a machine learning project that aims to apply artificial intelligence concepts on business data.</description>

      <description>Bio I earned my PhD at Karolinska Instituet and I am proud alumnus of the Linnarsson Lab. My original training is in Biotechnology (BSc @UNIPA) and Biomedicine (MSc @KI) but nowadays I will probably turn around if somebody is calling out for a Molecular Biologist, Computational Biologist or Bioinformatician.
My research focuses on understanding brain development. I am particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons.</description>

      <description>Openings and available projects Postdoctoral researcher Read the full call in pdf here!
The research project offered will be focused on developing new computational approaches to integrate single-cell/nuclei RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data generated from archival material. The successful candidate will develop new analysis approaches and apply them to a comprehensive human oligodendroglia dataset. The overarching goal is understanding gene regulation in the specification and maintenance of oligodendrocyte lineage in the human brain.</description>
