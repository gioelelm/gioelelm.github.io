We wrote a piece with Giovanni D'Angelo titled ["The lipotype hypothesis"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41580-022-00556-w) on Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology! <br>
Considering recent evidence on lipid-cell response to interaction cues, we proposed that cell variability in lipid composition assists the divergence of differentiation trajectories, leading to the establishment of several cell identities.
