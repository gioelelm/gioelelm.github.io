## About

 <div style="text-align: justify">
We are a computational and developmental biology lab with a focus on understanding the complexities and dynamics of brain development. Our approach combines single-cell genomics, spatial omics technologies, and machine learning tools. Our use of techniques like RNA velocity allow us to trace the future states of individual cells, predicting developmental trajectories and cellular fate decisions in the process of differentiating embryonic stem cells into mature neurons.

A significant aspect of our research is the exploration of lipid heterogeneity at the single-cell level. We believe this emerging field holds the key to understanding how different biochemical drivers, including lipids, influence the dynamic process of brain development.

Our long-term goal is to unravel the intricate gene regulatory programs that drive the formation of cell types in the nervous system. By doing so, we hope to contribute to the understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders and the improvement of cell replacement therapies.
