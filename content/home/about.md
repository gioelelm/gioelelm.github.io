## About

 <div style="text-align: justify">
We are a computational and developmental biology lab focused on understanding the complexities and dynamics of brain development. Our approach combines single-cell and spatial omics technologies with machine learning and Bayesian statistical methods. We develop computational tools like RNA velocity (velocyto, VeloCycle, Pyro-Velocity) that trace the future states of individual cells, predicting developmental trajectories and cellular fate decisions.

A major focus of our research is spatial lipidomics, exploring lipid heterogeneity at cellular resolution. Through our uMAIA framework, we construct multidimensional metabolomic atlases that reveal how lipid diversity shapes brain development. We also develop deep learning methods like Spotiflow for subpixel-accurate detection in fluorescence microscopy and spatial transcriptomics.

Our long-term goal is to unravel the intricate gene regulatory programs and metabolic signatures that drive the formation of cell types in the nervous system. By doing so, we aim to contribute to understanding neurodevelopmental disorders and improving cell replacement therapies.
