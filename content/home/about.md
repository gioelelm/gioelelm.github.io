## About
 
Our research focuses on understanding how the cell types in nervous system are made.
We are particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons in the central nervous system and the retina.
 
We tackle this question using quantitative methods and machine learning tools. We have used the wealth of data provided by [single cell RNA sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2801). We make use of other genomics techniques to understand the complex gene regulation programs that lead to the formation of cell types in the nervous system.

One of the long-term goals of the lab is to contribute in making biology from a descriptive to a predictive science. We are convinced that this knowledge on fundamental processes are valuable to help shedding light on pathologies of the nervous system and the eye.

We welcome applications from both experimentalists and analysts, being  curious about how the nervous system develops and a quantitative mindset are an important plus.
