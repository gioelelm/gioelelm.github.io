## About

 <div style="text-align: justify">
<i>How does cellular diversity emerge in the brain?</i> This question drives our research. Our methodological pursuits are directed toward answering it by building a comprehensive model of brain development.

The name of our lab, the Laboratory of Brain Development and Biological Data Science, captures our belief that confronting the complexity of brain development requires making optimal use of large datasets: developing ways to generate, analyze, and extract meaning from them. We study brain cell states collectively, examining their diversity, molecular composition, spatial organization, and changes over time. We examine multiple molecular layers together, recognizing that cell properties arise from how these interact to shape fate decisions.

Our contributions include technical innovations, landmark resources, and discoveries that converge into expanding models for neural cell fate emergence. We pioneer cell-type discovery and atlasing in the developing nervous system, develop transformative methods to study transcriptome dynamics, and explore heterogeneity beyond gene expression using single-cell and spatial lipidomics. We see the complexity of the brain as an opportunity rather than an obstacle.
