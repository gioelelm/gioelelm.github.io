## About
 <div style="text-align: justify">
Our research focuses on understanding how the *cell types* in the nervous system are made.
We are particularly interested in describing the sequence of states that embryonic stem cells go through during their differentiation towards mature neurons in the *central nervous system* and the *retina*. 
 
We make use of highly quantitative single-cell genomics techniques and machine learning tools to address our scientific questions. For example, we have used the wealth of data provided by [single cell RNA sequencing](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2801) to characterize the developmental process in [entire tissues](https://ki.se/en/news/new-method-reveals-cell-development). One of the long-term goals of the lab is to understand the complex gene regulatory programs that lead to the formation of cell types in the nervous system.

With our work, we have the ambition to contribute to the fight against *neurodegenerative and blinding diseases*. However we are wary of overselling our research as translational, what we do is *basic research* and we feel privileged of being granted this opportunity. We are convinced that our data-oriented and quantitative approach to biology is the way to build up information that can, then, immediatelly be used to [support applied efforts](https://ki.se/en/news/midbrain-study-gives-boost-to-parkinsons-research).
