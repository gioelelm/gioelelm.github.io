Using a combination of sequencing techniques and mathematical methods, our lab has traced the genetic programs that direct the development of each cell in the brain. This molecular map help understanding how the brain develops and provide insights into a range of brain disorders. [Nature paper here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03775-x#citeas)
