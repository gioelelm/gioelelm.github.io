We are pleased to announce that we have been awarded an SNSF Spark grant!

This CHF 100,000 grant (Jan 2025 - Dec 2026) will support our project "Charting the Individuality of Neural Progenitor State Transition Sequences by Hyperspectral Time-lapse Imaging."

This exploratory project will develop new approaches to track individual neural progenitor cells as they make fate decisions, combining live imaging with computational analysis to understand the temporal dynamics of neural differentiation.
