+++

We are delighted to announce that Irina Khven has successfully defended her PhD thesis!

Irina's thesis, "Fine-grained mapping of neural progenitors subtypes in the embryonic brain unveils context-dependent roles of signalling on cell fate decisions," represents a major contribution to our understanding of brain development.

During her PhD in the EDNE program (2019-2025), Irina made fundamental contributions to mapping neural progenitor diversity using spatial transcriptomics and single-cell approaches. Her work has been instrumental in establishing the lab's spatial transcriptomics capabilities and generating some of the most comprehensive datasets on embryonic brain development.

Irina will continue her scientific career as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB).

Congratulations Dr. Khven, and best wishes for your future research!
