We are thrilled to celebrate Alex Lederer's successful PhD defense!

Alex joined the lab as a PhD student in the Computational and Quantitative Biology program (EDCB) in 2019. His research focused on deciphering the nature of cell state transitions in single cells using quantitative modeling of temporal dynamics. His work contributed to major advances in RNA velocity methods, including developments in VeloCycle.

Alex has now moved on to become a Senior Data Scientist at CHUV. We wish him all the best in his new role!
