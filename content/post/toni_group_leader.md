We are proud to announce that Dr. Antonio Herrera, a postdoctoral researcher in our lab since 2021, has been awarded a prestigious Ramón y Cajal fellowship!

Toni will start his own research group at the University of Granada, Spain, in the second half of 2026.

During his time in the La Manno Lab, Toni has made fundamental contributions to our research program, including developing computational methods for spatial transcriptomics analysis and contributing to multiple high-impact publications. His work on deep learning methods for imaging and spatial biology has been particularly impactful.

We are excited to see Toni establish his own independent research program and look forward to future collaborations. Congratulations Toni!
