This week Simone Codelluppi and Lars Borm, in our lab have been releasing to the world their creation: osmFISH, a fantastic technique they have been optimizing to perfection! I really reccomand to read the [preprint here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/04/276097)"""

Simone Codelluppi and Lars Borm have developed and optimized a cyclic smFISH protocol, termed ouroboros smFISH, to quantify the expression of a large number of genes in tissue sections. The goal was building a cell type map of the mouse somatosensory cortex. The results are really impressive. See the fantastic images and interactively explore the data using the Loom viewer [here](http://linnarssonlab.org/osmFISH/).

Great news are not only is taht Lars and Simore have put a lot of effort to make it possible for any lab to set up the method and they provide [detailed protocol](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/04/276097) and a polished [software package]((http://linnarssonlab.org/osmFISH/availability/)).
