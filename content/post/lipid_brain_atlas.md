We are excited to announce the release of the **Lipid Brain Atlas** - a high-resolution mapping of membrane lipids in the mouse brain!

This work, led by [Luca Fusar Bassini](/people/lucafusar/) in collaboration with Giovanni D'Angelo's lab, reveals that **lipids act as zip codes for fine-grained brain anatomy**.

## Key Discoveries

### Lipizones: A New Way to Map the Brain
We discovered **lipizones** - brain territories defined purely by lipid composition, without any anatomical assumptions. Remarkably, lipid profiles alone can predict 3D brain tissue coordinates with high accuracy.

### Oligodendrocyte Heterogeneity
We found striking lipid heterogeneity among oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum, suggesting that these cells are far more diverse than previously appreciated.

### Connecting Cell Bodies to Axon Terminals
Lipid signatures can connect cell bodies to their distant axon terminals, opening new ways to study brain connectivity through biochemistry.

### Ventricular System Zonation
We uncovered biochemical zonation patterns in the choroid plexus and ventricular linings, regions critical for cerebrospinal fluid production.

### Pregnancy and Sex Differences
Perhaps most surprisingly, pregnancy triggers coordinated membrane adaptations across brain regions. We also found sex differences in white matter sphingolipids that amplify during pregnancy.

## Why This Matters

The atlas enables tracking how disease, aging, diet, and medications reshape brain lipid composition at the cellular level. This opens new avenues for understanding:
- Cell-type specific metabolism
- Developmental history encoded in membranes
- Connectivity patterns revealed through lipid fingerprints
