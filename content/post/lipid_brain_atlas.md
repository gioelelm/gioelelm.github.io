We are excited to announce the release of our preprint "The Lipidomics Architecture of the Mouse Brain" on bioRxiv!

This work represents a major milestone for our lab, presenting the first comprehensive spatial lipidomic atlas of the adult mouse brain. Using high-resolution MALDI mass spectrometry imaging, we mapped 172 membrane lipids across 109 sections and 11 brains, all registered to the Allen Brain Atlas.

Key findings:
- We identified 539 spatially coherent biochemical domains, which we call "lipizones"
- Lipizones capture both neuronal cell bodies and their distal terminals
- White matter shows marked regional heterogeneity driven by oligodendrocyte-specific lipids
- We discovered that pregnancy induces coordinated lipid remodeling in the cortex and white matter

This atlas establishes lipids as an important and previously unexplored axis of molecular brain architecture.
