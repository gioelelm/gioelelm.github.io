We are thrilled to announce that the La Manno Lab has been awarded a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant for the project "MOVIOLA: Cell decision capture and control via joint Raman live and omics profiling."

This 5-year grant (Feb 2026 - Jan 2031, 1.5 million euros) will support our research into understanding the molecular determinants that govern neural cell fate decisions during human brain development.

The MOVIOLA project introduces a novel experimental paradigm that combines live Raman microscopy with multi-modal molecular profiling to capture cells at the precise moments when fate decisions occur. We will develop the "Rewind, Halt & Edit" methodology, which enables:

- Retrospective identification of decision points through continuous cellular monitoring
- Targeted profiling at critical moments
- Temporal manipulation of decision factors

Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural systems, we aim to identify the specific molecular factors—including transcription cascades, signaling pathways, metabolic states, and lipid compositions—that drive individual fate choices.

The ERC Starting Grant is one of the most prestigious and competitive funding schemes for early-career researchers in Europe, and we are grateful for this opportunity to advance our research program.
