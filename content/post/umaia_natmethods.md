We are excited to announce the publication of our work on uMAIA (unified Mass Imaging Analyzer) in Nature Methods.

uMAIA is an analytical framework for the joint analysis of large mass spectrometry imaging datasets. It enables the construction of multidimensional metabolomic atlases by extracting, aligning, and normalizing data into coherent, accurate maps. We applied this framework to study developmental lipidomics, creating detailed 4D lipid maps across embryonic stages.

This work represents a significant step forward in our understanding of how lipid diversity contributes to brain development and cellular identity.
