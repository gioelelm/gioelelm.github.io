We are excited to announce that we have been awarded a Zeiss IDEAS grant!

This CHF 100,000 grant (Mar 2025 - Feb 2026) will support our research on "Neural Interpolation of 3D Distributions from Sections" - developing computational methods to reconstruct volumetric molecular distributions from 2D tissue section data.

This project builds on our expertise in spatial transcriptomics and will advance our capabilities for building 3D molecular atlases of brain development.
