We are pleased to announce that we have been awarded an SNSF R'Equip grant for the acquisition of a next-generation MALDI imaging system!

This CHF 1,000,000 grant (Jan 2025 - Dec 2026) will fund a state-of-the-art mass spectrometry imaging platform that enables fast and high-sensitivity spatial metabolomics. The new equipment will significantly enhance our capabilities for spatial lipidomics research and support our ongoing projects on brain lipid architecture.

This shared equipment will benefit multiple research groups at EPFL working on spatial metabolomics applications.
