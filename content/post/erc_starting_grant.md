We are thrilled to announce that the La Manno Lab has received a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant for the project "ELATE: Extracting Laws of brain development from single-cell transcriptome dynamics."

This 5-year grant will support our research into understanding the fundamental principles governing brain development through the lens of single-cell genomics and RNA velocity analysis. The project aims to develop new computational methods and apply them to uncover the regulatory logic underlying neuronal differentiation and brain formation.

The ERC Starting Grant is one of the most prestigious and competitive funding schemes for early-career researchers in Europe, and we are grateful for this opportunity to advance our research program.
