We are pleased to announce that the La Manno Lab has received a Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) Starting Grant.

This grant will support our research into understanding the role of lipid heterogeneity in brain development. The project combines mass spectrometry imaging with computational analysis to explore how different lipid species contribute to cellular identity and developmental processes in the nervous system.

The SNSF Starting Grant provides essential support for our experimental and computational work at the interface of spatial metabolomics and developmental biology.
