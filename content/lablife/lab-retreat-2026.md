In January 2026, we did the first La Manno retreat! We spent a night in Le Locle, in the canton on Neuchâtel, and visited the famous Moulins souterrains. We had a lot of science and fun brainstorming sessions, but a highlight was definitely the noodle-cooking session led by our own PhD student Xinyi Huang!
