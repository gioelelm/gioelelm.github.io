uMAIA (unified Mass Imaging Analyzer) is an analytical framework for the joint analysis of large mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) datasets. It enables the construction of multidimensional metabolomic atlases by extracting, aligning, and normalizing data into coherent, accurate maps.

Key features:
- Joint analysis of large MSI datasets
- Spatial lipidomics clustering and imputation
- Differential analysis tools
- 4D lipid mapping across developmental stages
