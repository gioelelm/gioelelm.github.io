VeloCycle is a Bayesian model of RNA velocity that couples velocity field and manifold estimation in a unified framework, enabling formal statistical testing of gene expression dynamics. It fits an inferentially coherent model directly on raw data, eliminating heuristics that dominate current scRNA analyses.

Key features:
- Formal statistical testing of dynamics
- End-to-end Bayesian inference
- Cell cycle speed quantification
- Manifold-constrained velocity estimation
