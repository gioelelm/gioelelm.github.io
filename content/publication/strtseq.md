abstract = "Single-cell RNA-seq has become routine for discovering cell types and revealing cellular diversity, but archived human brain samples still pose a challenge to current high-throughput platforms. We present STRT-seq-2i, an addressable 9600-microwell array platform, combining sampling by limiting dilution or FACS, with imaging and high throughput at competitive cost. We applied the platform to fresh single mouse cortical cells and to frozen post-mortem human cortical nuclei, matching the performance of a previous lower-throughput platform while retaining a high degree of flexibility, potentially also for other high-throughput applications."
