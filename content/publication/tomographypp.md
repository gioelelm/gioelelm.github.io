abstract = "Several techniques are currently being developed for spatially resolved omics profiling, but each new method requires the setup of specific detection strategies or specialized instrumentation. Here we describe an imaging-free framework to localize high-throughput readouts within a tissue by cutting the sample into thin strips in a way that allows subsequent image reconstruction. We implemented this framework to transform a low-input RNA sequencing protocol into an imaging-free spatial transcriptomics technique (called STRP-seq) and validated it by profiling the spatial transcriptome of the mouse brain. We applied the technique to the brain of the Australian bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps. Our results reveal the molecular anatomy of the telencephalon of this lizard, providing evidence for a marked regionalization of the reptilian pallium and subpallium. We expect that STRP-seq can be used to derive spatially resolved data from a range of other omics techniques."
