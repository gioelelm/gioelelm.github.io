abstract = "Neural tube organoids are emerging as powerful models for studying nervous system development. Here, we report a self-organizing neural tube organoid system derived from mouse embryonic stem cells that recapitulates key aspects of embryonic neural tube development, including proper dorsal-ventral patterning, neurogenesis, and morphogenesis."
