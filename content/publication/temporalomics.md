abstract = "Single-cell genomics now provides unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, yet capturing the temporal dimension of cellular processes remains challenging. Here we review emerging approaches for inferring temporal information from single-cell data, including RNA velocity, metabolic labeling, and lineage tracing, discussing their potential to transform our understanding of dynamic biological processes."
