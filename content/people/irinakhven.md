# Short Bio

I have recently completed my Masters at [Moscow State University, Department of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics](https://www.msu.ru/en/info/struct/depts/fbb.html). During my undergraduate studies Iâ€™ve worked in a molecular biology lab and received a comprehensive training in many techniques. Both of my  internships - in [Weis lab at ETH Zurich](http://www.bc.biol.ethz.ch/research/weis.html) and in [Seigert lab at IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/life-sciences/siegert-group/) - helped me realize that molecular neuroscience is the most exciting branch of modern biology to me.

I chose to do my PhD in La Manno group because it is a great chance to work on the interface of neuroscience, developmental biology and systems biology. My project will be dedicated to the retina development and regeneration. Using a set of state-of-art experimental techniques like scRNA-seq and [cyclic smFISH](http://linnarssonlab.org/osmFISH/), I hope to be able to contribute to our knowledge in this field.
