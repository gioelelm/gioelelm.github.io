# Short Bio

I am a Master's student in the Life Sciences Engineering program at EPFL. Prior to arriving at EPFL, I completed four years of the six-year program in Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at the Lomonosov Moscow State University.

My engagement with La Manno lab began in 2021 when I had the privilege of joining as a grant recipient of the Zimin Foundation - SMTB Alumni [Summer Research Program](https://molbioschool.org/en/page/scholarship). The following year, I officially joined the La Manno lab team as a student research assistant. I am currently developing a Bayesian model for the dynamical analysis of single-cell transcriptomics data in collaboration with the [Pinello lab](https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/clinical-trials-and-research/center-for-cancer-research/investigators/pinello-lab). My research is principally centered on transfer learning methods, aiming to utilize large single-cell atlases to elucidate gene expression dynamics during tissue development.

During my undergraduate studies, I was working at [Khrameeva lab](https://crei.skoltech.ru/cls/research-projects/khrameeva/), where I acquired first-hand experience in analyzing genomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics data as a part of a multidisciplinary international research group.
