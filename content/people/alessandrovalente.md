I am a PhD student in the Neuroscience Program (EDNE) in the La Manno Lab. I have a strong interest in the applications of statistical models and data analysis to the health sciences. After completing my M.Sc. in Biotechnology and Bioengineering at the University of Milan, during which I completed an internship in the La Manno Lab, I returned to the lab full time as a PhD student.

My research focuses on studying the lipidome and the construction of a Lipid Brain Atlas based on mass spectrometry data. I have other interests including tennis, hiking, baking, and jamming!
