# Short Bio

I am a PhD student in the Computational and Quantitative Biology (EDCB) program at EPFL. Originally from the United States, I completed my BSc in Molecular Biology and Computer Science at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) before working as a research fellow at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.de/).

During my studies, I have been captivated by the concept of [temporal omics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166919301430) and bioinformatics in light of the big data boom and advances in next-generation sequencing technologies. One ambition of my PhD is to help bridge the gap between experimental and computational approaches, since the most important discoveries in biology will ultimately benefit from a union of these perspectives. I am using single-cell transcriptomic methods to explore the developing nervous system and eye in several species. I am also contributing to expansion of the bioinformatics toolkit available to the single-cell community. I enjoy collaborating as part of an interdisciplinary team and at a university with a strong reputation for working at the interface of biology and computation.

Proud alumnus of the [Steinmetz](https://www.embl.de/research/units/genome_biology/steinmetz/) and [Arndt labs](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/person/karen-arndt).
