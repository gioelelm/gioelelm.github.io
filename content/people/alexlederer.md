# Short Bio

I am an incoming PhD student of the Computational and Quantitative Biology (EDCB) Program at EPFL. Originally from the United States, I completed my BSc in Molecular Biology and Computer Science at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) before working as a bioinformatician at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.de/).

During my studies, I have been captivated by the rapidly-growing field of bioinformatics in light of the big data boom and ongoing advances in next-generation sequencing technologies. I will use a hybrid of novel experimental and computational methods to explore the neurodevelopment of the retina in several species. I also aim to contribute to the expansion of the bioinformatics toolkit available to the genomics community. I am excited to be part of an interdisciplinary team and a university with a strong reputation for working at the interface of biology and computation.

Proud alumnus of the [Steinmetz](https://www.embl.de/research/units/genome_biology/steinmetz/) and [Arndt labs](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/person/karen-arndt).
