# Openings and available projects

## Masters Projects

**Short Projects** (spring)<br>
**Identification and isolation of neural stem cells using smFISH and RNA-based cell sorting**<br>
Development... Pattering...
Single cell RNA sequencing provides fine and detail molecular description of the heterogeneity of tissues but since cells are dissociated spatial information is lost.
Sorting cells based on protein level relies on the availability and quality of antibodies, in comparison sorting cells based on the expression levels of specific mRNA offers.
The project involves the design of a panel of markers that allow the isolation of different kind of neural progenitors cells at different stages of their commitment and differentiation.

## PhD student position

An interdisciplinary Ph.D. project in developmental neuroscience and systems biology is available at La Manno lab. The successful candidate will use a combination of cutting-edge single-cell genomics techniques, including RNA velocity, to study the embryonic development of the retina.

The project will explore the gene regulation process leading to the determination of the different cell types in the mouse and human retina. The candidate will collect and analyze multi-omics data from single-cells to achieve a better understanding of the different stem cell states and how they transition into mature neurons.
The project will put the candidate at the interface between neurodevelopmental biology and data science. Therefore, we welcome applications from candidates with education in either the biological sciences or applied mathematics, interested in developing beyond the boundaries of their original training.

The research will be conducted within the environment of the EPFL School of Life Sciences and with the opportunity for international collaborations with leading members of the single- cell genomics community.

## Postdoctoral researcher

We welcome the application for talented individuals interested in the development of the nervous system.
Both experimentalists and analysts are welcome to apply.
