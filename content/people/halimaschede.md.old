# Blurb
 
I am a current Masters student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/) in the department of [Life Sciences and Technology](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/lifesciences/). I completed my BSc in Cell Biology and Anatomy, specializing in genetics, with a minor in Mathematics at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), Canada.

It is here at EPFL where I feel like I have finally found my place in the scientific domain. I have developed a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in particular, their applications to the health sciences.

With the oncoming of the [data era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data), I believe the knowledge of how to analyze data and utilize it for the creation of predictive models will become powerful tools for medicine in the near future. I would very much like to be a part of this change.
