# Short Bio

I am an MD student visiting EPFL as part of my doctoral research project. While studying medicine at [Charité](https://www.charite.de/), my research focus has been developing molecular biotechnologies for clinical application in neurological diseases, with projects based in Berlin, India and Central Africa. As part of my home university’s lab for [Translational Neurogenomics](https://translationalgenomics.charite.de/forschung/ag_schuelke/), I joined the La Manno Lab with a key interest in quantitative systems biology of single cells. 

During my research stay at EPFL, I am working on the development of techniques in [spatial omics](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.04.235655v1) and [temporal omics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166919301430), both in the wet lab and bioinformatic settings. Currently, I am applying these techniques to study central nervous system development in vertebrates and fruit flies. My long-term vision is to contribute to the convergence of quantitative biology and medical research.
