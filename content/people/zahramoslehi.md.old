# Short Bio

I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Yazd University, my M.Sc. degree in Software Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, and my Ph.D. degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Isfahan University of Technology](https://www.iut.ac.ir/en/). During my doctoral studies, I made two research visits at the University of Geneva and University of Sheffield. After my Ph.D., I continued my research and teaching experiences at Isfahan University of Technology, University of Isfahan, and Shahid Beheshti University, Iran. 

I joined the La Manno lab as a postdoctoral researcher to develop pipelines for the integration of snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets for clustering purposes and to build robust prediction models of transitions between cellular states. I aim to correlate dynamical changes in the chromatin accessibility landscape with RNA velocity to determine if whether we can build models with which robust prediction of future states can be made. Calculating ATAC-to-RNA distance is not trivial and I will apply machine learning approaches to learn the distance metric function. With my background on metric learning and representation learning, I will work on learning a good distance metric for this integration problem.
