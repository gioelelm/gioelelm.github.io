# Short Bio

My name is Roger Aylagas Torres and I am from Barcelona, Catalonia. I studied my BSc in Telecommunication Engineering at the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://telecos.upc.edu/en) with a minor in Audiovisual Signal Processing and I am currently pursuing a MSc in Advanced Telecommunication also at UPC with the path of Artificial Intelligence for Multimedia.

I am currently doing my Master Thesis in the La Manno Lab and I am working on building a self-supervised algorithm for the integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data.
