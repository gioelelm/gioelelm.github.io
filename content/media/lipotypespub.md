summary = "Using single-cell lipidomics our lab and the lab of Giovanni D'Angelo  discovered the existence of lipotypes, cell states characterized by their lipid composition. We describe how lipid composition can play a key role in determining functional transitions. [Science paper here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh1623)"
