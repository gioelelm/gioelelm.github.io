# TODOs

- change the image for the Lipidpmocs Architecture post and selected publication does not come from the actual paper
- note that most often you can use the image from the news post of EPFL it has tipically a good aspect ratio
- news of the ERC grant and SNSF grant are importnat make sure they are there and a good image is used (there should be a link to the EPFL news post about it)
- add an image with the Clarivate logo for the Clarivate Highly Cited Researcher announcement 2025
- I should be add the current master students in the lab to the team list
- I should be changing the gif at background that should be generated somehow with generative AI starting from images of my figures
- Velocycel published... post has a too long aspect ration image, change it
- The last Welcome post are for Luca and Alessandrom but many more people joined the lab since then
- Also Luca won BIF, worth saying in the same feed of news
- The outreach section is too long make it so that, like for posts, there is a more news to expand it but by default show only the last 10 piece of news
- Zeiss ideas grant and the SNSF spark and the R'equip did not made the news so remove them from the outreach posts
-
