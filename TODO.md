# TODOs

- I should be changing the gif at background that should be generated somehow with generative AI starting from images of my figures
- Velocycel published... post has a too long aspect ration image, change it
- The last Welcome post are for Luca and Alessandrom but many more people joined the lab since then
- Also Luca won BIF, worth saying in the same feed of news
- The outreach section is too long make it so that, like for posts, there is a more news to expand it but by default show only the last 10 piece of news
- in the "what's new" section, clicking on the title / text / read more should send to a page to read, please make it
